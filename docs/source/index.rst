Description
===========

**SIR-MIG** is an algorithm based on the inversion code SIR. It parallelises SIR and implements functionalities to use multiple random guesses.
There are three different modes selectable:

- 1C : 1 Component Inversion
- 2C : 2 Component Inversion
- MC : Monte-Carlo Simulation

It is also possible to use it without random guesses.

Check out the :doc:`doc` section for further infromations.

Check out the :doc:`code` section for further infromations about the code.

Check out the :doc:`usage` section for further information how to use and install the program.

Check out the :doc:`functions` section for a list of functions.

Check out the :doc:`preprocess` module for a description of functions which are used to preprocess data.

Check out the :doc:`classes` section for a list of classes which are used to read and write the Stokes profiles and the models.

Check out the :doc:`plots` section for a list of functions to plot the results.
